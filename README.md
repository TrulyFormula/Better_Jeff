## About The Project

In the high-octane world of F1, the thrill of competition is often marred by the shadow of unfair advantages. From minor speed boosts to drastic grip enhancements, the quest for victory has seen various forms of cheating. While securing open lobbies remains a broader challenge, TrulyFormula AntiCheat is here to make league racing a bastion of trust and fair play.

Our approach involves a lightweight client that monitors for any unauthorized modifications to F1 data, ensuring a clean and fair racing environment without intruding on user privacy. We believe in safeguarding not just the integrity of league races but also the trust and data privacy of every racer.

**Your feedback and questions are invaluable. Please don't hesitate to reach out!**

## Latest Updates

**Transitioning to V3:** In light of a significant security concern, we have decided to cancel versions V1 and V2. V3 is under development, focusing on enhancing user experience with Discord account linking and a user-friendly GUI for updates and startup. Despite its necessity, the nature of this software means it may still trigger antivirus alerts. We are continuously working to minimize false positives without compromising its effectiveness.

**A heartfelt thank you to our beta testers and community members for their invaluable feedback and support.**
