<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We all know that F1 is filled with cheaters from people adding 2% speed to people adding 200% more speed!

I can't make open lobbies safer but i can make league races safer so that what i set out to do.

This works but users running the client. The client scans the pc for any software or running program that can edit f1 data.

This is safe to use and NO data from the users pc is collected (#Trust is more important then some crap data)

All i want is for f1 league racing to be a trusted safe place!

Please DM me if you have any question!

  ```
### Installation V1

1. Download V1
 
2. Send to uses that are on pc in your league
   
3. Get the uses to run the program before starting the race

NOTE *Program will take about 1GB of ram but it will self close so lose in reces.

4. A code is created to prove that the user has loaded f1 with anyother programs.
### Installation V2+

   ```sh
   /get key
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space program to ensure that users are legal (like the FIA)

You cant edit the program to see how it works and most data is stored online in a locked location

Having data stored online means i can update all users at once and keep everything up to date!
