<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We all know that F1 is filled with cheaters from people adding 2% speed to people adding 200% more grip taking turn 1 at full speed!

I can't make open lobbies safer but i can make league races safer so that what i set out to do.

This works but users running the client. The client scans the pc for any software or running program that can edit f1 data.

This is safe to use and NO data from the users pc is collected (#Trust is more important then some crap data)

All I want is for F1 league racing to be a trusted and safe place again!

Please DM me if you have any questions!

<!-- Updates -->
## Latest Updates

Cancelled V1 and V2 due to a MAJOR security issue (Found before anything bad happened)

So now im working on V3 without a discord BOT but it will have discord account linking and a GUI for updates and starting. 

Anti-VIRUS will pick this up still due to its nature.

Thanks again for those testers for giving me live lobbies to test in. Still DONT have to join the discord server! There is nothing there yet

WEB_Notes v1.0.1

Thank you to all the users that used the beta versions.
We got some good data on how people tried to bypass it.
I found out what you the users want and im here to apply it.
We now are in V1 fully release and i have update how to download.
Please join the discord server to get more updates.

Thank you and enjoy clean lobbys 

-Side Note-

Yes most anti-virus pick up that its Malware/Ransomware this is due it read active programs and change data points from F1.

I havent found how to fix this and i doubt i will but i keep trying.
