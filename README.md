### Empowering Better Racing
So what is the project that I am working on now?

Better_Jeff, In the games jeff or mark would give out some stupid calls or give us players a target that shouldn't be given at the point in the race so my goal is to replace him with my own. The goal is to have a call out system that tells the driver what they really need to know and when. Things like ERS or weather strategy can be assisted by better jeff to allow the driver to keep eye on the road. ERS track mapping will be a system that allows ERS to feel more realistic by having modes that can be setup in the menu and selected on track "I have no battery! Okay copy mode 7." 

This is all still in the planning mode at the moment as I am learning a new language to complete this task in the best way I can.

So what was the old project?

Well in F1 24 EA added there own anti cheat that had the permisions that I did not like editing game code to test if a external factor is editing it. This project ran from the F1 22 game to F1 24 however after 2 weeks into the new game I saw that the new game had an anti-cheat that really worked so i knew it was time to call it quits.

Reason for these closing is a lack of need for it now. This page wasnt updated after the first release as the users and teams that needed the Anti-Cheat were in the discord and got updates from there.

I would like to thank the teams that used my software and helped me make it better and helped them clean out lobbies. The great thing about it was that people that didnt use the software also the ones who were also suspected of cheating. So just having users download the tool worked as a deterrent. The software could of done nothing but the fear of it catching them was enough.
