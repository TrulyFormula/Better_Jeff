### Empowering Better Racing

This was an anti cheat for the F1 games that ran from F1 22 - F1 24. In F1 24 EA added there own anti cheat that had the permisions that I did not. So i closed the project to move on to new things. 

Discord - Close
Website - Close

Reason for these closing is a lack of need for them now. This page wasnt updated as the users and teams that needed the Anti-Cheat were in the discord and got updates from there.

I would like to thank the teams that used it.
